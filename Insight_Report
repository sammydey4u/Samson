Titanic Dashboard: Generated Insights Report
This report summarizes key insights derived from the Titanic disaster dataset, as presented in the interactive dashboard. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of passenger demographics, survival rates, and fare distribution, enabling a deeper understanding of the factors influencing survival.

Key Metrics Overview:

Total Passengers: The dashboard analyzes data for 889 passengers.

Average Age: The average age of passengers on board was 24 years.

Overall Survival Rate: The overall survival rate across all passengers was 38%.

Gender Distribution: There were 577 male passengers and 312 female passengers.

Total Fares: The total fares collected amounted to $29,100, with specific breakdowns for First ($18,017.41), Second ($3,801.84), and Third ($6,714.70) class tickets.

Survival Rate Analysis:

1. Survival Rate by Gender:

Females had a significantly higher survival rate (74%) compared to males (20%). This highlights a strong correlation between gender and survival, likely due to the "women and children first" protocol.

2. Survival Rate by Passenger Class:

First-class passengers had the highest survival rate at 63%.

Second-class passengers had a survival rate of 46%.

Third-class passengers had the lowest survival rate at 25%.


This indicates that passenger class played a crucial role in survival, possibly due to better access to lifeboats or cabin locations.

3. Survival Rate by Passengers (Child vs. Adult):

The dashboard shows a higher survival rate for women and children compared to men. This further supports the "women and children first" directive.

Passenger Demographics and Distribution:

1. Age Distribution:

The age distribution chart shows a diverse range of ages among passengers, with a notable peak in younger adults, and a decreasing number of passengers as age increases.

2. Passengers by Embarkation Town:

Southampton was the primary embarkation town, with 644 passengers.

Cherbourg had 168 passengers.

Queenstown had 77 passengers.


This insight provides context on the origin of the passengers.

Fare Analysis:

1. Average Fare Paid per Class:

First-class tickets had the highest average fare at $84.19.

Second-class tickets averaged $20.66.

Third-class tickets had the lowest average fare at $13.60.


This data correlates with the survival rates by class, suggesting that higher fares corresponded to a better chance of survival.

Conclusion:

The Titanic dashboard effectively visualizes critical aspects of the disaster, clearly illustrating that gender and passenger class were significant determinants of survival rates. Women and children, along with first-class passengers, had considerably higher chances of survival. The dashboard serves as a powerful tool for understanding the demographic and social factors that influenced the outcomes of the Titanic tragedy.
