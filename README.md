# Titanic Survival Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project presents an interactive dashboard built using Power BI to analyze the factors influencing survival rates during the tragic Titanic disaster. The goal is to visually explore the dataset, uncover key trends, and provide insights into the demographics and conditions that played a role in who survived.

## Problem Statement / Objective

The primary objective of this project is to:

  * Understand the distribution of passengers by various categories (gender, class, age, embarkation town).
  * Analyze how different factors, particularly gender and passenger class, correlated with survival rates.
  * Visualize the total and average fares paid across different passenger classes.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is the well-known Titanic dataset, commonly found on platforms like Kaggle. It contains information about passengers, including their age, gender, class, fare, and survival status.

## Key Features & Dashboard Highlights

The dashboard is designed for easy navigation and provides a comprehensive view of the data:

  * *Interactive Filters:* Apply filters for Age, Embark Town, Class, and Gender to drill down into specific segments of the data.
  * *Survival Rate Analysis:* Visualizations clearly show survival rates broken down by gender, passenger class, and age group.
  * *Passenger Distribution:* Charts illustrating the distribution of passengers by embarkation town and age.
  * *Fare Overview:* Displays total fares collected and average fares paid per passenger class.

## Generated Insights (Summary)

The analysis reveals several critical insights:

  * *Gender and Class as Key Determinants:* Women and children, particularly those in higher passenger classes, had significantly higher survival rates compared to their male counterparts and lower-class passengers.
  * *Southampton as Primary Embarkation:* The majority of passengers embarked from Southampton.
  * *Fare-Survival Correlation:* Higher average fares paid in first class correlated with higher survival rates.

For a detailed breakdown of all generated insights, please refer to the [Detailed Insights Report](https://github.com/sammydey4u/Titanic-Survival-Analyis-Dasboard/commit/889ddc882c6d9703b8a17f8f0088a26f1d2b1850).

## Tools Used

  * *Power BI Desktop:* For data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation.
  * *Excel / Google Sheets:* For initial data inspection and any minor data cleaning.
  * *Python (Pandas, Matplotlib - Optional):* If used for more complex data manipulation or exploratory data analysis prior to Power BI.

## How to View the Dashboard

## Future Enhancements

  * Integrate additional external data sources (e.g., lifeboat capacities, deck plans) for richer analysis.
  * Perform more advanced statistical analysis to confirm correlations.
  * Explore family size impact on survival.
